Hey there, {{ user.username }}

As Ruqqus is growing and introducing new features, we are also updating our terms of service to clarify how Ruqqus may be used. The goal is to ensure that freedom and transparency continue on in our platform. These go into effect today, 09 October 2020. As a reminder, your continued use of Ruqqus constitutes acceptance of these new terms.

Here is a summary of what's changing:

1. **API Terms** - With the successful introduction of API endpoints, we are adding some technobabble regarding acceptable use of the feature. (If you aren't a developer, you probably don't need to worry about this.)

2. **Bot Rules** - We are adding some additional rules for bots. In short, bots must identify themselves to us as a bot, and are also not permitted to vote. (Again, if you aren't developing, you probably don't need to worry about this.)

3. **Guildmaster Policy** - We've added some clarification on how we expect Guildmasters to behave when administrating their guilds. While we aim for freedom by design, backing it up by policy is also a good idea.

Thanks for using Ruqqus!
